# Overview
Mass production of millions of unique anime characters is nearly impossible for the best painter, but it is easy using machine learning method! In the guided project, you will have the chance to build machine learning models and produce the anime characters for yourself. After then, you will also handle the machine learning method called Deep Convolutional Generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), which is used for the mass anime production.

# Learn Objective

- Understand the original formulation of GANs, and their two separately trained networks: Generator and Discriminator
- Implement GANs on simulated and real datasets
- Apply DCGANs to a dataset
- Understand how to train DCGANs
- Generate an image using a DCGAN
- Understand how changing the input of the latent space of DCGANs changes the generated image

# Setup Libraries

- pandas for managing the data.
- numpy for mathematical operations.
- sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- seaborn for visualizing the data.
- matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
- keras for loading datasets.
- tensorflow for machine learning and neural network related functions.
